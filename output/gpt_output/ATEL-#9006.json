Subsequent i-band photometry acquired 28 days after discovery shows that the object faded by ~ 0.2 mags. No photometry was acquired during the intervening period, but difference photometry extracted from ATLAS implies activity before the PS1 discovery. The ATLAS lightcurve is roughly flat at o ~ 17.5 mags between 58 and 31 days before PS1 discovery possibly indicating a type IIP SN."
