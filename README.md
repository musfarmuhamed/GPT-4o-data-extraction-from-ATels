Contributors: Musfar Muhamed Kozhikkal, Andrei Variu, Lizbeth Joy Tan

## Description
### Overview

This project represents the initial phase of developing a system for generating AstroCOLIBRI alerts based on Astronomer’s Telegrams (ATELs). The aim is to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of astronomical data extraction and alert generation.

### Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to leverage the capabilities of GPT-4 to systematically extract astronomical sources along with their positional coordinates, specifically Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (DEC), from the content of ATEL alerts. This will involve parsing the text of these alerts to identify relevant information accurately.

### Methodology

In this phase, we will focus on two main tasks:

- Data Extraction: Utilizing GPT-4’s natural language processing abilities, we will extract all pertinent sources mentioned in the ATELs, ensuring that both RA and DEC coordinates are accurately captured.

- Accuracy Evaluation: After extraction, we will conduct a thorough evaluation of the accuracy of the data obtained through GPT-4. This step is crucial as it allows us to assess whether the model meets our standards for reliability in astronomical data processing.

### Comparative Analysis

Building upon our previous work where we employed REGEX and AstroBERT for similar tasks, this project will also include a comparative analysis. We will evaluate whether GPT-4 provides superior performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency compared to our earlier methods. This analysis will help determine the most effective approach for future implementations in astronomical data handling.

By conducting this research, we aim not only to improve our current methodologies but also to contribute valuable insights into the application of advanced AI techniques in astronomy.
